# Automated Discrimination

This folder contains the results of an experiment that assesses how Facebook and Google skew the distribution of advertisements, absent any targeting from the advertiser. It is a replication of the following paper:

> Ali, M., Sapiezynski, P., Bogen, M., Korolova, A., Mislove, A., & Rieke, A. (2019). Discrimination through Optimization: How Facebook's Ad Delivery Can Lead to Biased Outcomes. _Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction_, 3(CSCW), 1-30.

### These are the results of the main experiment on Facebook.

### A similar experiment on Google provided different results. However, for a reason we ignore, Google did not let us run ads with an unlimited bid. Capping the bid might have the effect of disturbing the optimization algorithm.
